## **Todo Tasks**

### **BooksDB**
- [ ] Add exception handling when reading config.
- [ ] Add character escaping for book file names.

### **Conccurency**
- [ ] Develop a service that generates cover when it detects new book has been added. Currently this is done upon request but this method adds uncessary overhead (in the seconds range).
- [ ] Stop using tuple to represent book object and instead make a Book class.

### **Enviornment**
- [ ] Add support for dotenv to allow for quick access to changing config without needing to replicate those changes.
